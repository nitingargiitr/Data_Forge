Passwords must contain at least one uppercase letter,  \none lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.\nEXCEPTION: Legacy systems running on Windows Server 2012 R2 or older may use  \nminimum 8-character passwords due to system limitations. These systems must be  \nupgraded by December 31, 2025, OR isolated on a separate network segment with  \nadditional monitoring.\nPassword expiration: 90 days for standard accounts, 60 days for privileged  \naccounts. However, NIST guidelines (SP 800-63B) recommend against forced  \npassword changes unless compromise is suspected. This creates a CONTRADICTION",
